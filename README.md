# Darksky-weather-app


A weather app to show weather forecasting using [Dark Sky API]


## Technologies used:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/)
- [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev/)

## Getting Started

To get started, please clone this git repository and then run `npm install` once under the client directory. 

```
git clone https://github.com/NoranMaher/Darksky-Weather.git
cd Darksky-Weather
cd client
npm install
```
This will install the dependencies for the client side.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode, using the Webpack-provided "development server".<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  


## An API Server
The text and scripts above describe the client-side code that is displayed in the web browser. They rely on the Webpack-provided development server that runs on port 3000. 
First you need to open a separate command line window, and run `npm install` under the project's `server` directory. 

```
cd Darksky-Weather
cd server
npm install
```

### `npm run server`
